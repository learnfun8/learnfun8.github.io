        <h6 id="Surface Mucous Cells" >Surface Mucous Cells</h6>
   
           
        <p id=info-smc>Surface mucous cells, also called foveolar cells, <br>
        are specialized cells lining the stomach's surface and gastric pits,<br>
        producing a thick, alkaline mucus that protects the stomach lining from its own corrosive acid (hydrochloric acid)<br>
        and digestive enzymes like pepsin, while also helping food pass through. <br>
        These cells constantly regenerate to maintain this vital protective barrier,<br>
        unlike intestinal goblet cells, and differ in mucus composition and cell structure. </p>
    </p>
    <h6 id=Mucos Neck Cells>Mucous Neck Cells</h6>
    <p>Mucous neck cells are specialized cells in the stomach's gastric glands <br>
        that secrete mucus to protect the stomach lining from the highly acidic environment.<br>
        They are located in the neck of the glands, are smaller than surface mucous cells, <br>
        and produce a thin, acidic mucus that differs from the alkaline mucus of surface cells.<br>
        In addition to secreting mucus, they are believed to be progenitor cells for the gastric epithelium,<br>
        capable of division and differentiation into other cell types</p>
    <h6 id="Parietal Cells">"Parietal Cells"</h6>
    <p>Parietal cells are specialized cells in the stomach lining (gastric glands)<br>
        that produce two vital substances: hydrochloric acid (HCl), which digests food and kills pathogens,<br>
        and intrinsic factor, essential for absorbing Vitamin B12.<br>
        Located in the stomach's fundus and body, these dynamic cells secrete HCl via proton pumps (H+-K+-ATPase) <br>
        and are crucial for nutrient absorption and gastric health,<br>
        playing roles in conditions like acid reflux, gastritis, and pernicious anemia. </p>
    <h6 id="Cheif Cells"> Chief Cells </h6>
        <p>Chief cells are vital cells in the stomach's gastric glands that produce <br>
            and secrete pepsinogen (a protein-digesting enzyme precursor) <br>
            and gastric lipase, crucial for breaking down proteins and fats;<br>
            they are stimulated by neural and hormonal signals,<br>
            and their secretion is activated by stomach acid (HCl) from parietal cells. <br>
            They also exist in the parathyroid glands,<br>
            where they produce Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) to regulate calcium levels,<br>
            but "chief cells" typically refers to the gastric type in digestion. </p>
        <h6 id="Enteroendocrine Cells">Enteroendocrine Cells</h6>
        <p>Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are specialized chemosensory cells<br>
            scattered throughout the gut lining that act as the body's largest endocrine organ, <br>
            sensing nutrients and microbes to release diverse hormones (like GLP-1, CCK, ghrelin) controlling digestion,<br>
            appetite, gut motility, and the vital brain-gut axis. They form crucial neuroendocrine circuits,<br>
            linking nutrient intake and gut environment to systemic metabolic and neural responses, <br>
            playing roles in everything from satiety to inflammatory bowel disease. </p>

        <h6 id="Epithelium">Epithelium </h6>
        <p>The stomach's epithelium is a specialized simple columnar epithelium, <br>
            forming a single layer of cells that line the gastric pits and glands,<br>
            its primary role being protection and secretion, featuring <a href="#Surface Mucous Cells">surface mucous cells</a> <br>
            that secrete protective alkaline mucus, along with <a href="#Parietal Cells">parietal</a>(acid-producing) <br>
            and chief (enzyme-producing) cells, all originating from stem cells for rapid renewal,<br>
            forming a vital barrier against the stomach's harsh environment. </p>
        <h6 id="Lamina propria and Muscularis mucosae">Lamina propria and Muscularis mucosae</h6>
        <p>In the stomach's innermost layer (mucosa), the lamina propria is the connective tissue <br>
            bed beneath the surface lining (epithelium), rich in blood vessels, lymphatics, and glands, <br>
            while the muscularis mucosae is the thin, underlying smooth muscle layer <br>
            that separates the mucosa from the submucosa, creating gentle movements<br>
            to help secrete substances and fold the lining. </p>
